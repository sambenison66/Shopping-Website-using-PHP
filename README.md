# Shopping-Website-using-PHP
This project is to create a shopping website where the user can browse for items and add/remove the items to/from the shopping cart. eBay API is used for search result data, and the results were returned from eBay as XML data set which is processed and displayed back in the website. Please note that, this project has been deployed in a private server called Omega, so you might need to modify the deployment details as per your needs.
